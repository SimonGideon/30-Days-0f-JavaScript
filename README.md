# 30-Days-0f-JavaScript
This is a series of leaning and practicing JavaScript for 30 Days
# Day 1
  # Introduction
  
   ## Syntax
  These are rules that governs a Java Script as a programing language. THis involves:
    1. Declaring of different variables.
    2. Commenting
    3. Printing out
   ## Varriables
  These are storage containers for data in a code.  They are declared using assignment operator(=). For you to call a variables in Javascript, we use the key words, **const**(when the declared varriables is unchanged) and **let**(when the declared varriable is compromised). (var -  is an old school way of declaring variable and is efficient with the old Javascript lines of code. But with the latest version of Javascript it may result errors that may lead to a long hours of deburging so just avoid using var).
  Functional proramming languages such as [**Scala**](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and [**Elarng**](https://www.erlang.org/) that forbid change of variable values.
   ### Naming of Variables in Javascript
   * The name must contain only letters , digits and symbols; $(dollar) or _ (underscore).
   * The first character must not be a digit/number
      #### Name your varriables like a pro in Javascript
      > Variable naming technique brings a distinction between an experienced programmer and a novice. 
        ##### How to name varriables like a pro.
        * Use human-readable names
           ```javascript
           const userName = Admin;
           ```
        * Avoid abbreviations.
           ```javascript
            let a = "Today";
             b = "Wednesday";
             ///calling a variable in a  line variable is applicable but since we want to code like a **pro**, we use different lines
            ```
        * Use maximum Decriptive names (Verbose Variables).
        * Agree to the terms with you collegeus, team or coding patners.
          > Avoid subtle code (Difficult to analyse)
